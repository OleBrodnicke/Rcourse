Codemanagment: sharing code with colaborators
Install packages in the same directory: Do not install packages through RStudio but in R itself (as admin)
Check out www.flutterbys.com.au
Create a project for each analysis - Always create a git repository
Git: Snapshot of your version history of your analysis/project - In the staging area you chose which files you snapshot - Finaly repository stores (commits your files)
The head in git points at where to add the next commit when working on alternate versions of an analysis.
Config git so it and your colaborators know your name and email (action once)
Gitignore stores what files you do not want to commint in your repository

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
